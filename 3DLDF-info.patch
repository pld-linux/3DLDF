+Since 3DLDF does not yet have an input routine, user code must be
+written in C++  (in `main.web', or some other file) and compiled.
+Then, 3DLDF must be relinked, together with the new file of object code
+resulting from the compilation.  For now, the important point is that
+the text of the examples in this manual represent C++  code.
+@xref{Installing and Running 3DLDF}, for more information.
